# Data-Analytics-Pipeline-with-Python-SQL

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from data extraction to data analysis.

The dataset was collected using the **Kaggle API**, then processed and transformed using **Python (Pandas)**. After cleaning and transforming the data, it was loaded into **SQL Server**, where analytical queries were applied to generate meaningful insights.

This project focuses on real-world data handling practices such as data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), and SQL-based analysis.
